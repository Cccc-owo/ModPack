# Cccc's Simple Modpack

![icon](cover.png)

Hi, This is my modpack's source code. Some information is the following.

**Powered by [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)**

## How To Use It?

You can refer to [Modrinth's Document](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/) as the modpack is for [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpacks).

## About The Modpack

The Modpack is aim at better *vanilla* experience.

Apart from various optimization mods, it may include a few mods I like(eg.[Wild Firefly](https://modrinth.com/mod/wildfirefly)), but I will keep their number relatively small.

## Support Versions

Currently, the modpack supports Minecraft 1.16.5, 1.18.2, 1.19.

You can check corresponding branch to know more about them.

More versions to be supported are based on my favor.

## Fabric or Forge

Obviously, this modpack is for Fabric, and I do NOT have any intension to make a Forge version because many mods of which are just for Fabric.
